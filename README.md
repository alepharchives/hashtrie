Hashtries
=========

**ht** is a hashtrie with good insert properties and descent lookup properties.
It has similar properties to dict in lookup, but faster inserts. 

The test data indicates very good properties but a big disclaimer here,
- Update seems very slow.
- The overall structure consumes more memory then dict.
- This is not very well tested so there might be some problems somewhere =)

Also this is just a concept, not intended for production.
